## What this is
The intent of this list is to provide recommendations for mods that would be useful to many new users. The full mods list in [CVRMG Discord](https://discord.gg/dndGPM3bxu) or [CVRMelonAssistant](https://github.com/knah/CVRMelonAssistant/releases) has a lot of mods, which can be overwhelming to go through. 

I would still recommend joining the CVRMG discord linked above so you do not miss important announcements. General instructions for installing Melonloader is in the #how-to channel. If you have any issue with mods, please post in #help-and-support and let us know!

*All of these mod download links are through CVRMG's API links. These mods have been reviewed for safety and security. If you download mods from other sources take care to verify their legitimacy.* 
# ------------- Core ------------- 
You should install these core mods and plugin, they are required for other mods to work and ensure the best experience. 
### UI Expansion Kit
>This mod provides a unified mod settings UI (you can't miss it).
>[ReadMe](https://github.com/knah/ChilloutMods#ui-expansion-kit)

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/90
### BTKUILib
> This mod is designed to make it very simple to create functional menus within the ChilloutVR Quick Menu. The whole goal of this library is to provide a simple API to create usable menus properly integrated within the CVR QuickMenu, all without ever having to touch Cohtml! [...]

### CVRModUpdater
**!! This goes in your Plugins folder !!** Everything else in this list is a mod, but CVRModUpdater is a plugin and must go in the plugins folder!
>Automatically update installed mods on game start and checks for broken mods
> [ReadMe](https://github.com/Slaynash/CVRModUpdater#readme)

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/19

*If you do not wish to use an Auto Updater, the mod [UpdateChecker](https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/53) is an alternative, although CVRModUpdater will work better.*

# ------------- Quality of Life -------------
### NoIntro
> Always skip Chillout's intro when game starts, roughly take 10 seconds.

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/35

### PortableMirrorMod
> This mod allows the user to locally spawn mirrors for themselves in any world.

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/70

### FreedomFingers
For Index Knuckles controllers
>This removes the annoying index controller toggle to switch between finger tracking and animation, replacing it with a gesture lock toggle. Where your fingers are tracked **all** the time but you can pick whether you want gestures or not. You can enable notifications in the melon config, to know whether the gestures are enabled or not.
>Check [README.md](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/tree/master/FreedomFingers) for more info

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/101

### GestureLock
For Quest, Vive, or any non-Index controllers
>Locks GestureLeft & GestureRight on SteamVR binding. Does nothing on Knuckles controllers. Make sure to bind Controller Toggle Gestures in SteamVR.
>[ReadMe](https://github.com/NotAKidOnSteam/NAK_CVR_Mods/tree/main/GestureLock#readme)

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/93

### GestureIndicator
>If you ever used Index controllers, you may know how unreliable the finger tracking can be. This causes all kinds of awkward issues when you try to express yourself in front of someone without looking at a mirror. Gesture Indicator displays on the HUD which gestures you are currently doing. The text colors, transparency \u0026 positions can be customizable to your liking!

### NoHighlight
I recommend setting it to fade instead of remove completely
>Removes Highlights/Glow from Props (and maybe other things). Optionally just fades it out after 2 seconds

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/24


### ImmersiveTouch
>ImmersiveTouch provides a satisfying haptic feedback in your VR controllers when your hands interacts with objects (meshes). The vibrations are speed dependent which means stroking hairs/tails etc feels very nice.
>[ReadMe](https://github.com/ImTiara/CVRMods#immersivetouch)

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/4


### WorldPropListMod
>Provides a list of all the props in a world with details such as the player that spawned it, distance and location, tags and more. You can delete + block individual props and highlight or create a line towards their location.
