## What this is
The intent of this list is to provide recommendations for mods that would be useful to many new users. The full mods list in [CVRMG Discord](https://discord.gg/dndGPM3bxu) or [CVRMelonAssistant](https://github.com/knah/CVRMelonAssistant/releases) has a lot of mods, which can be overwhelming to go through. 

I would still recommend joining the CVRMG discord linked above so you do not miss important announcements. General instructions for installing Melonloader is in the #how-to channel. If you have any issue with mods, please post in #help-and-support and let us know!

*All of these mod download links are through CVRMG's API links. These mods have been reviewed for safety and security. If you download mods from other sources take care to verify their legitimacy.* 
# ------------- Core ------------- 
You should install these core mods and plugin, they are required for other mods to work and ensure the best experience. 
### UI Expansion Kit

### BTKUILib

### CVRModUpdater
**!! This goes in your Plugins folder !!** Everything else in this list is a mod, but CVRModUpdater is a plugin and must go in the plugins folder!
>Automatically update installed mods on game start and checks for broken mods
> [ReadMe](https://github.com/Slaynash/CVRModUpdater#readme)

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/19

*If you do not wish to use an Auto Updater, the mod [UpdateChecker](https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/53) is an alternative, although CVRModUpdater will work better.*

# ------------- Quality of Life -------------
### NoIntro
> Always skip Chillout's intro when game starts, roughly take 10 seconds.

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/35

### FreedomFingers
For Index Knuckles controllers
>This removes the annoying index controller toggle to switch between finger tracking and animation, replacing it with a gesture lock toggle. Where your fingers are tracked **all** the time but you can pick whether you want gestures or not. You can enable notifications in the melon config, to know whether the gestures are enabled or not.
>Check [README.md](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/tree/master/FreedomFingers) for more info

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/101

### GestureLock
For Quest, Vive, or any non-Index controllers
>Locks GestureLeft & GestureRight on SteamVR binding. Does nothing on Knuckles controllers. Make sure to bind Controller Toggle Gestures in SteamVR.
>[ReadMe](https://github.com/NotAKidOnSteam/GestureLock/#readme)

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/93

### GestureIndicator
>If you ever used Index controllers, you may know how unreliable the finger tracking can be. This causes all kinds of awkward issues when you try to express yourself in front of someone without looking at a mirror. Gesture Indicator displays on the HUD which gestures you are currently doing. The text colors, transparency \u0026 positions can be customizable to your liking!
>[ReadMe](https://github.com/ImTiara/CVRMods#gestureindicator)
 
 https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/25

### NoHighlight
I recommend setting it to fade instead of remove completely
>Removes Highlights/Glow from Props (and maybe other things). Optionally just fades it out after 2 seconds

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/24

### CameraIndicator
>A mod that gives you a indicator of where other players cameras are positioned!

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/80


### PickupPushPull
>Allows you to push & pull pickups with Mouse, Gamepad,  VR. Can also optionally rotate props via keybind. Index users will need to manually bind the missing SteamVR binds.
>[ReadMe](https://github.com/NotAKidOnSteam/PickupPushPull/#pickuppushpull)

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/91

### ImmersiveTouch
>ImmersiveTouch provides a satisfying haptic feedback in your VR controllers when your hands interacts with objects (meshes). The vibrations are speed dependent which means stroking hairs/tails etc feels very nice.
>[ReadMe](https://github.com/ImTiara/CVRMods#immersivetouch)

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/4


### WorldPropListMod
>Provides a list of all the props in a world with details such as the player that spawned it, distance and location, tags and more. You can delete + block individual props and highlight or create a line towards their location.

### CCK.Debugger
Very useful for avatar creators. Though may cause lag if your avatar has MANY CCK components. (Never version that fixes that is coming soon)
>The Content Creation Debugger allows you to debug `avatars`, `props` and `misc`. 
>**Menu** - Menu that displays useful information like: - Avatar and Props `synced`/`local` parameter values - Prop Pickups and Attach Info - Avatar & Props Pointers/Triggers detailed info 
>**Visualizers** - Toggleable Component visualizers: - Pointers and Triggers 3D shape - Trigger `OnEnter` (green), `OnExit` (red), `OnStay` (yellow) events - IK bones - FBT Trackers 
>Click [here](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/tree/master/CCK.Debugger "here") for a more **in-depth** readme (with pictures).

### Action Menu
>Radial menu to quickly control your avatar and game settings with just a few taps of your joystick. By default opens with long-press of the quick menu button. It's been designed with simplicity, customization and modding in mind

# ------------- Improves built in game features -------------
### AASBufferFix
>Fixes two issues with the Avatar Advanced Settings buffers when loading remote avatars. In simple terms, it means 'fewer wardrobe malfunctions'. 
>Empty buffer (all 0/false) will no longer be applied on load.\nReceived AAS data is ignored until the wearer has loaded into the expected avatar. (The avatar will sit in its default state until the wearer has loaded and started syncing correct AAS) AAS will no longer be sent while switching avatar. Please view the GitHub [ReadMe](https://github.com/NotAKidOnSteam/AASBufferFix/#readme) for links to relevant feedback posts.

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/126

### BetterLipsync 
>Mod to replace the viseme controller with the oculus lipsync. It will apply to all avatars but just locally (so others without the mod will still see the CVR default visemes behaviour). It was implemented to do the heavy work in separated threads, so there shouldn't be a noticeable performance drop. Make sure to play with the configurations to get the best look for yourself, I've set the default settings to be my personal preference. Some people prefer more smoothing other people prefer less.
>Check [README.md](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/tree/master/BetterLipsync) for comparison videos and more info."

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/112

### EyeMovementFix
> Mod to attempt to fix some of the current issues with the eye movement. This will affect the local and remote players eye movement but only for the local client. As well as adding new features! 
> **Enhancements** - The target system will prefer people that: Are closer both distance and from the view center, are currently talking, are not a mirror reflection, and are the local player (yourself) :) . Check [README.md](https://github.com/kafeijao/Kafe_CVR_Mods/tree/master/EyeMovementFix "README.md") for more in-depth info including which issues were addressed.

https://api.cvrmg.com/v1/mods/download/118

# ------------- Fixes -------------


### FuckToes
>Prevents VRIK from using toe bones in VR & optionally FBT. VRIK calculates weird center of mass when toes are mapped, so it is sometimes desired to unmap toes to prevent an avatars feet from resting far back. Please see the [README](https://github.com/NotAKidOnSteam/FuckToes/#readme) for relevant imagery detailing the problem.

This fixes a noticeable CPU stutter caused by the default nameplate fade out calculations.

### FuckMetrics

> This mod limits UpdateMetrics & SendCoreUpdate while the menus are closed. This helps to alleviate hitching and performance issues, particularly with FPS drops while unmuted in online instances and VRIK tapping in place.
> [ReadMe](https://github.com/NotAKidOnSteam/FuckMetrics/#readme)

> load, makes avatar switching to avatars and spawning props that
> already have been seen before almost instantaneous.
> [ReadMe/Source](https://github.com/ZettaiVR/CVR-Mods/#readme)

A great mod for larger instances, ie clubs, if you have the RAM to support it.       
     
*This can result in high RAM usage, if you experience users getting stuck loading, please try increasing the Load Timeout to a much higher number. If that doesn't work, turn on debugging in MelonPrefs and report a bug.*    
*Settings will be in the Zettai category in MelonPerfs*     
**------------ 'Enable Hologram' is true by default, disable it ------------**        
**^^^^^^^^^ If you don't everyone will look weird ^^^^^^^^^**
